leanmass is a program that will calculate the amount of lean body weight you have. There is also an option to get the amount of fat your holding. The calculations are done in lbs.

I made this program because it will help a person figure out if they want to set a goal whether to lose or gain weight. I used it to calculate my macros for carbs, protein, and fats. 

Something to add is an option for kg's if some prefer that unit over lbs.
